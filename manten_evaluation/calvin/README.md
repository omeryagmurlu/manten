- install calvin in a new, separate environment
- in the original (manten) environment: run `python manten/scripts/agent_proxy`
- edit the evaluate_policy.yaml as necessary and run evaluate_policy.py

notes:

- if you have problems while installing calvin with pyhash, remove it from the requirements.txt and install via conda, it installs the binary directly and worked for me at least
